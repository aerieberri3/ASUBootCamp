About Me
My name is Erin Schofield. I like traveling and crafting.
I grew up in Glendale, Arizona.
I started working out as a customer service representative for an insurance company.
I currently do mortgage services. Most of my proffessional experience is explaining how algorithms impact costs.
Its prompted a curiousity about how these algorithms work.
I hope to gain that understanding through this course.
